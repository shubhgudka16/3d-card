# 🌟 3D Glass Card Design

A visually stunning **3D interactive profile card** built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
It features a modern glassmorphism style with smooth hover animations, layered circular effects, and social media buttons that pop in 3D space.

## 🪄 Features
- ✨ Pure HTML + CSS — no JavaScript required  
- 💎 Glassmorphism and neon gradient styling  
- 🌀 Realistic 3D rotation effect on hover  
- 🌐 Interactive social media icons with depth animation  
- 👤 Custom name/title area and “View More” button  

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — for structure  
- **CSS3** — for layout, gradients, and 3D transforms  

---

## 🧩 How to Use

1. Download both files:  
   - `3d card.html`  
   - `3d.css`  

2. Make sure both files are in the same folder.

3. Open `3d card.html` in any web browser.  
   You’ll see an animated 3D card appear in the center of the screen.

## 💻 Preview
When you hover over the card:
- It tilts in 3D space using `transform: rotate3d()`  
- The circular logo layers rise to different depths  
- The social media buttons float outward with smooth transitions  

---

## 🎨 Customization Tips
- Change the **name** inside the `<span class="title">` tag to your own.  
- Replace the **SVG icons** inside the `.social-buttons-container` with links to your social profiles.  
- Adjust colors in `3d.css` to match your theme — look for lines with `background: linear-gradient(...)`.
